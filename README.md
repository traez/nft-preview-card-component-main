## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (very poorly done)

### What I learned

Practiced use of responsive units to great effect.

### Continued development

I failed terribly when it comes to mobile view (too tired to start styling all over again for mobile),
Also failed to apply image overlay on hover.
Will study and research more to correct on next project.
